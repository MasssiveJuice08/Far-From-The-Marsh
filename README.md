> "Honored marshbrother,
>
> This land is cold to us, but we find solace here. Sheogorad is a harsh place. It has taught us much. We trace paths whispered by wise ones. This next day, I delve into currents as deep as Hist roots. If swept away, know I walked where our swamps touch the sky. Guard our marsh-kin, as the Hist watches over us.

> Walk well, wet and dry."

A Mages Guild member studying hidden patterns of Mysticism and prophecy has gone missing. Explore their cave retreat in Sheogorad for clues about their ultimate fate. You can find ther cave west of Dagon Fel. Follow the road west and then north to a river crossing â€“ the cave entrance is on the left.

> [!WARNING]
> A quest outline and initial dialogue has been written, but not yet implemented; this will be added in a future update. In the meantime, you can expect a pretty cave with the mage's journal and some environmental story-telling.
